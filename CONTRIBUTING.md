# How to Contribute

We're excited to have you contribute!

## Contribution Workflow
1.  Find an issue you'd like to work on and ask to be assigned.
2.  Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.
3.  Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
4.  Create a new branch for your feature: `git checkout -b issue-5-add-health-check`.
5.  Make your changes and commit them with a clear message.
6.  Push your changes to your forked repository.
7.  Create a Pull Request (PR) from your branch to the main repository's `main` branch. Please link the issue you are solving in the PR description (e.g., "Closes #5").
